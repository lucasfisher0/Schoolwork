{\centering Introduction\par}
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “technology” as a “practical application of knowledge.” As a society, we have obtained chemical and biological knowledge that we can use to affect ourselves. Drugs as any other form of technology must be analyzed to identify both its harms and benefits, and the potential of either. This paper looks at the impacts that drugs have had on society and critiques on how they should be regulated, along with the current attempts of drug regulation in the United States.
